#### Haas WWII Rebalance is a mod for ARMA3, intended for use with the [2. Panzer Division ARMA Community](https://2pzd.net/).

#### Required dependencies:
* [IFA3 Lite](https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/190809-iron-front-in-arm3-lite-preview-versions/) - Preview v31 hotfix 1
* [FOW](https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/198194-faces-of-war-ww2/) - Release V
* [LEN Weapons](https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/200914-len-weapons-pack-for-ifa3-lite/) v1.0
* [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3) v3.12.3, Common, Captives, Fragmentation, Overpressure, and Trenches
- The optional Hass_ACE3_Tracers_Compat requires the ACE_Tracers pbo found in the optionals folder of the ACE3 mod.
This adds the ACE3 Tracers to IFA3, FOW, and LEN ammunition.
If you are already using WW2/ACE3 Tracer Compats they will be superseded by this, as will the optional ACE tracers compat included in the IFA3/ACE3 compat mod.
* The optional Haas_Command_Vics requires ACRE2 v2.6.0 and my [IFA3/ACRE2](https://github.com/Drofseh/IFA3_ACRE2_COMPAT) and [FOW/ACRE2](https://github.com/Drofseh/FOW_ACRE2_Compat) compats.
This adds extra command tanks and vehicles that have an extra radio for the commander, making coordination of groups of vehicles easier.
