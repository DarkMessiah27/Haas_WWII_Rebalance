#### Haas WWII Rebalance is a mod for ARMA3, intended for use with the [2. Panzer Division ARMA Community](https://2pzd.net/).

#### Required dependencies:
* [IFA3 Lite](https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/190809-iron-front-in-arm3-lite-preview-versions/) - Preview v26
* [FOW](https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/198194-faces-of-war-ww2/) - Release IV
* [LEN Weapons](https://forums.bistudio.com/forums/topic/200914-len-weapons-pack-for-ifa3-lite/) v1.0
* [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3) v3.11.0, Common, Captives, Fragmentation, Overpressure, and Trenches

* The optional Hass_ACE3_Tracers_Compat also requires the ACE_Tracers pbo found in the optionals folder of the ACE3 mod.
If you are already using WW2/ACE3 Tracer Compats they will be superseded by this, as will the optional ACE tracers compat included in the IFA3/ACE3 compat mod.
* The optional Haas_Command_Vics also requires an ACRE2 dev branch build and IFA3/ACRE2 and FOW/ACRE2 compats (none of which have been released yet but are coming soon™).

#### Haas WWII Rebalance does the following:

* Changes the recoil of semi and full auto weapons
* Corrects the weight of weapons to real life values
* Corrects the descriptions and display names of weapons and magazines
* Corrects full auto rates of fire
* Adds compatibility for magazines, both for weapons that share magazines, and for weapons that are in two or more of IFA3, FOW, or LEN
* Adds missing firemodes
* Adds a couple of weapons and magazines
* Other things not listed here, read the changelogs or the code.
